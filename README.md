# 3D-Modeling-of-Orbits-within-the-exoplanetary-system-K266

I used the updated version of Vpython to create two visual representations of the orbits within the system K2 - 266. In other words, the code makes use of several astrophysical equations to not only generate 3D my models of the orbits but also generate graphs that track these orbits in the y direction in real time. The end goal was to represent the orbit of the host star are accurately as possible, which required me to incorporate the motion of multiple planets. 
For more conceptualization of what my code is doing, see the attached paper and presentation. 
Like the rest of my codes, they were created on jupyter notebook. It is possible for this code to be adapted to other planets, the only requirement is that the data come from NASA Exoplanet Archive, as they are in the best suited format to be read into an ascii table (they can be exported onto excel sheets). 
For a more in depth explaination of my code and what it's doing, see the attached paper.
